    <div class="greeting">Dear Hiring Manager,</div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
        I am writing to express my strong interest in a waiter position at Sushi House. As a native Japanese speaker and Alameda resident, I would be honored to join your team at one of the Bay Area's most beloved sushi destinations.
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
        I am fluent in Japanese (speaking, reading, and writing) and deeply knowledgeable about Japanese dining customs and etiquette. This allows me to authentically serve Japanese-speaking customers while helping English-speaking guests navigate your extensive menu. Having grown up immersed in Japanese culture, I understand the importance of attentive service and creating memorable dining experiences.
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
        My experience includes working at Nijiya Market, a Japanese grocery store, where I assisted customers in both English and Japanese while managing inventory and maintaining high food handling standards. I have also been actively cooking and cleaning with my church community since 2024, developing strong skills in food preparation, dishwashing, and working efficiently in team-oriented, high-volume environments. Additionally, I worked with Japanese executives at Astar Network and Genero Inc., where all communication was conducted entirely in Japanese.
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
        I thrive in fast-paced environments and genuinely appreciate the discipline and teamwork required in food service. I have a passion for Japanese cuisine that goes beyond the food—it's about creating warm, welcoming experiences for every guest. I would love to contribute to the efficient, friendly service that has made Sushi House a cherished gathering place in the community.
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
        I am available to start immediately and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm can benefit your team. Thank you for considering my application.

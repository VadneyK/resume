Message to the Hiring Team
I am a native Japanese speaker with practical voice performance experience and formal training in phonetics, prosody, and dialectal variation. My work at UC Berkeley’s Bancroft Library refined my attention to diction and script interpretation, and my professional EN/JA localization ensures precise control over tone and pacing. I’ve voice-acted for children for years with consistently positive feedback. I can deliver clean, consistent takes, follow direction, and adapt tone from instructional to character reads. Grateful for your consideration and ready to support high-quality Japanese voice data for your Voice AI project.
